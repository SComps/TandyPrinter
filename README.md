# TandyPrinter
This is the very beginnings of a printer application for the trs80gp Tandy emulator.

At this point, it is ONLY a listener; and specifically listens on localhost using port 1234.

Because these printers were largely line based, rather than spooler based like mainframes
and mini's each page is in it's own PDF file.  This may change in the future; but this seems
to be the best compromise at the moment.

Contributions are welcome to this project.  Everyone is free to participate without
regard to who they are or what their beliefs are.  If you understand VB.NET; you're 
welcome.
