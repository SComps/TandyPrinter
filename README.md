# TandyPrinter
This is the very beginnings of a printer application for the trs80gp Tandy emulator.

At this point, it is ONLY a listener; and specifically listens on localhost using port 1234.
It does NOT print anything yet; but simply outputs the data received from the emulator
on the console screen.

As this application develops it will output to a PDF file.
